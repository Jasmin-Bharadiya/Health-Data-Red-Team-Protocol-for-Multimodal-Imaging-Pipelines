# Health-Data-Red-Team-Protocol-for-Multimodal-Imaging-Pipelines
This research builds a red-team protocol for multimodal health pipelines, starting with ophthalmology. We create realistic failure scenarios across imaging and clinical metadata, test how LLMs behave under these corruptions, and design mitigation layers so models degrade safely rather than fail dangerously.
